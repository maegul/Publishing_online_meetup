Here is an update!!!

## MeetUp Plan
* GitHub
    * Repo
    * Adding files etc
    * Plug git integration
* Markdown
    * Quick example + render
    * Quick example + 
    	* GitHub pages + 
    	* themes
    * General markdown syntax
    	* github flavour
    	* linking to other pages
    	* index and readme file names
* HTML
	* jupyter notebooks as themselves and as HTML
	* RStudio


## General Idea
* Focus on basics of github pages and markdown.
* Show possibility of getting more complex with programming language specific possibilities, which may not be appropriate for OpenRes, but for exploration later on.


## GitHub + Markdown

[Good Cheat SHeet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)

[GitHub Guide (incl GHM)](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/)

[Original Markdown Cheat Sheet](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics)

This is some text
And this is some more.


[putting a repo online](https://maegul.github.io/DataViz_web_plotly_cheat_sheet/github_pages_gif.html)

* GitHub Basics
	* Account
	* Repo
		* readme (what this is/contains)
		* data (making sure credit/source is included)
		* code (commented)
		* explanation (written text, containing motivation for project, analysis/interpretation of code results and any inferences/conclusions)
	* Uploading files
		* Show git versioning
	* Store and Share Code
		* Forking, downloading, Commenting through issues
* Markdown 
	* Basic README.md example + Basic Markdown syntax
		* Heading; dot points; links; images
	* github flavoured markdown -> syntax highlighting
	* Using github pages
		* Settings to make github page
		* appropriate file names - index / readme
		* Themes (Jekyll)
		* linking to other pages


## Figshare
* Basic introduction to figshare
	* For larger data (and larger file sizes)
	* Give data a DOI (useful for citations)
	* Free
	* Unimelb account is better

* [Web Page](https://figshare.com)
* [Melbourne Figshare](https://melbourne.figshare.com)


## Python, R and Matlab
* Basic idea that markdown, as above, supported and used by these other coding environments too.
* Or, taking it further, can generate a file, such as HTML, that can live on github and be easily viewed.


### Python
* Save as HTML / Rendered on GitHub 
	* NBViewer as an alternative.
* [nbconvert](https://nbconvert.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
	* HTML
	* HTML + Template (Plugins)
	* slides 


### R
* RStudio Tools [webpage with tutorial and docs](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/index.html)
* RMarkdown
* Knitr + Code insertions -> HTML files
* Notebook (?)
* Slides and other Magic (?!)


### Matlab
* [Publish Matlab code](https://au.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/publishing-matlab-code.html)
* [Markup language](https://au.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/marking-up-matlab-comments-for-publishing.html)


## Going Further
* For Demo purposes
* Dashboards (Shiny, Dash, HTML widget and plug ins)
* Javascript and web dev
